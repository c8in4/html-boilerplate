    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>This page covers common image formats</p>
    
    <h2>JPGs</h2>
    <img src="../img/mochi.jpg" alt="white mochi" height="200" width="200">
    <p>JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. On the other hand, JPGs don't allow for transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the image below if you look real close:</p>
    
    <h2>GIFs</h2>
    <img src="../img/mochi.gif" alt="animation of a white mochi" height="200" width="200">
    <p>GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they're somewhat limited in terms of color paletteâ€”never use them for photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can't have semi-opaque pixels. This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. For this reason, it's usually better to use PNG images if you don't need animation.</p>

    <h2>PNGs</h2>
    <img src="../img/mochi.png" alt="white mochi" height="200" width="200">
    <p>PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don't have color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.</p>

    <h2>SVGs</h2>
    <img src="../img/mochi.svg" alt="white mochi" height="200" width="200">
    <p>Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. They're good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.</p>
